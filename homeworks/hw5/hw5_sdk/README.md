To test the interpreter, first construct a file in the Imp language.  Take a look at some examples in the examples directory for for notes on how to build some Imp language programs.  Then you can simple execute the following code within GHCI:
interp "examples/file_name.imp" where file_name.imp is one of the files in the examples directory.

Cheers :)
